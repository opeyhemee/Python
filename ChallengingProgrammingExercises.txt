Python Challenging Programming Exercises

1.	Level description
Level	Description
Level 1	Beginner means someone who has just gone through an introductory Python course. He can solve some problems with 1 or 2 Python classes or functions. Normally, the answers could directly be found in the textbooks.
Level 2	Intermediate means someone who has just learned Python, but already has a relatively strong programming background from before. He should be able to solve problems which may involve 3 or 3 Python classes or functions. The answers cannot be directly be found in the textbooks.
Level 3	Advanced. He should use Python to solve more complex problem using more rich libraries functions and data structures and algorithms. He is supposed to solve the problem using several Python standard packages and advanced techniques.

Question 1
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

Solution:
l=[]
for i in range(2000, 3201):
    if (i%7==0) and (i%5!=0):
        l.append(str(i))

print ','.join(l)

Question 2
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
def fact(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    return x * fact(x - 1)

x=int(raw_input())
print fact(x)

#----------------------------------------#

Question 3
Level 2

Question:
Write a program which takes a series of input. The first input is the array size and the subsequent ones are the array elements.

Example 1
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3
5
6
0
Then, the output of the program should be:
[5, 6, 0]


Example 2
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
7
8
7
4
1
5
8
12
Then, the output of the program should be:
[8,7,4,1,5,8,12]

Hints:
Take first input and use that for your loop that inserts to an array

Solution:

ArrayNam = []
V = int(input("Enter a number: "))
for x in range(0,V):
     Num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
     ArrayNam.append(Num)


print(ArrayNam)

Question 4
Level 2

Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given number. Every generated/subsequent number should be added to an array and then print the array afterward. Also, print the result of the factorial.

Example 1: Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8

Then, the output should be:
[8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]


40320

Example 2: Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
4

Then, the output should be:
[4,3,2,1]

24  

Solution:

ArrayNum =[]
Num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
RV = 1
constantNum = Num
for x in range(0, constantNum):
     ArrayNum.append(Num)
     RV = RV * Num
     Num = Num-1
print(ArrayNum)
print(RV)
